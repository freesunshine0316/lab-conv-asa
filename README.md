# Conversational Aspect Sentiment Analysis (CASA)

This repository contains the codes and data corresponding to the paper [CASA: Conversational Aspect Sentiment Analysis for Dialogue Understanding](https://jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/12802/26767). Currently the data is in Chinese, and we plan to extend this to English in future.


The main model requires a Chinese word segmentor (e.g., [jieba](https://github.com/fxsjy/jieba)) for preprocessing, and the released data has already been segmented. This branch however does not require word segmentation, it functions on character level.
